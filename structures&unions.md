## What keyword is used to define a structure in C?
```c
a) struct
b) union
c) typedef
d) define
```
- a)struct
## Which of the following statements is true about accessing members of a structure?
```c
a) Members are accessed using the dot (.) operator.
b) Members are accessed using the arrow (->) operator.
c) All members must have the same data type.
d) Structures cannot hold members of different data types.
```
- a) Members are accessed using the dot (.) operator.
## What is the size of a structure in memory?
```c
a) The size is always equal to the size of its largest member.
b) The size is the sum of the sizes of all its members.
c) The size depends on the compiler implementation.
d) Structures do not occupy any memory space
```
- c) The size depends on the compiler implementation.
## What is the difference between a structure and a union?
```c
a) Structures cannot hold different data types, while unions can.
b) Unions can only hold one value at a time, while structures can hold multiple values.
c) Structures are used for grouping related data, while unions are used for memory optimization.
d) All of the above.
```
- b) Unions can only hold one value at a time, while structures can hold multiple values.
## Which of the following statements is NOT valid for initializing a structure?
```c
a) Using a comma-separated list of values inside curly braces.
b) Assigning another structure variable of the same type.
c) Using individual assignment statements for each member.
d) Initializing only some members, leaving others undefined.
```
- d) Initializing only some members, leaving others undefined
## What is the purpose of the -> operator when accessing members of a structure?
```c
a) It is used to access members of a structure pointer variable.
b) It is used to modify members of a structure by reference.
c) It is an alternative way to access members of any structure.
d) It is not a valid operator for accessing structure members.
```
- a) It is used to access members of a structure pointer variable.
## How can you pass a structure by value to a function in C?
```c
a) By passing the structure name directly.
b) By passing the structure variable using the & (address-of) operator.
c) By creating a pointer to the structure and passing the pointer.
d) Structures cannot be passed by value to functions.
```
- a) By passing the structure name directly.
## What happens when you declare an array of structures?
```c
a) It creates a single structure variable that can hold multiple values.
b) It creates multiple copies of the same structure in memory.
c) It creates a contiguous block of memory to store multiple structures of the same type.
d) It creates a linked list of structures.
```
- c) It creates a contiguous block of memory to store multiple structures of the same type.
## What is padding in the context of structures?
```c
a) It is the process of adding extra bytes to the size of a structure to improve memory alignment.
b) It is a technique to optimize memory usage by storing smaller data types within larger ones. C) It is a
way to dynamically allocate memory for structures at runtime.
d) Padding is not relevant to structures in C.
```
- a) It is the process of adding extra bytes to the size of a structure to improve memory alignment.
## What is the most common use case for unions in C programming?
```c
a) To group related data of different types under a single name.
b) To store multiple values of the same type and access them interchangeably.
c) To improve code readability and maintainability.
d) To dynamically change the data type of a variable during program execution.
```
- a) To group related data of different types under a single name.
